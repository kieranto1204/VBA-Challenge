I've included 2 files, one is labeled unsolved and contains the vbs code and an excel workbook that has not been edited in any other way, running the vba script will populate the workbook with the correct numbers that were requested in the instructions.
The second file is labeled solved and it contains a workbook that has already run the vbs code.

When you download the files, you may need to go into properties by right clicking the file in your download file, and checking the box that allows for files with macros to be allowed to run on your computer.

The instructions for the assignment were as follows:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The Ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter tot he closing price at the end of the quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter tot he closing price at the end of the quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

Additionally we were also required to add:
- Functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest%increase", "Greatest%decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

We were also told not to forget, that the VBA script must run on every worksheet at once.
