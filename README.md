The instructions for the assignment were as follows:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The Ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter tot he closing price at the end of the quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter tot he closing price at the end of the quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

Additionally we were also required to add:
- Functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest%increase", "Greatest%decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

We were also told not to forget, that the VBA script must run on every worksheet at once.
